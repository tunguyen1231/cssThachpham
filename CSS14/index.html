	<p>""In vain is was to rake for Ambergriese in the pauncch of this Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry." SIR T. BROWN, V.E.</p>

	<p>It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the Pequod's deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.</p>
